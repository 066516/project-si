# Project Title

[Provide a brief, clear title for your Express and MongoDB project.]

## Description

[Give a brief description of your project. What does it do? What technologies does it use? Why did you create it? Explain that it's an Express application using MongoDB for data storage.]

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): Required for running the Node.js server.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): The database used by this project. Provide instructions on installing MongoDB or setting up a MongoDB database.

## Installation

Explain how to get a local copy up and running:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/066516/project-si.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd project-si/server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm run start

# The server will start on a default port 3001
```

# OR

Follow these steps to get your development environment running from a .zip file:

```bash
cd project-si/server
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm run start

# The server will start on a default port 3000


```

Before starting the client side of the application, make sure:

1. **Server is Running**
   Make sure the server side of the application is already running.

2. **MongoDB Connection**

   - This project uses MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service, so there's no need for a local MongoDB server.
   - The connection string to MongoDB Atlas in an `.env` file
   - Verify that the server can connect to MongoDB successfully.
